Speed up your PC for FREE

We take a look at the ways you can improve your PC's performance without it costing you a penny.

OPTIMISE YOUR DISK WITH ULTRADEFRAG

\<Screenshot 1>

After opening the program select a drive at the top and click the Analyze button to check the current state of your drive. You'll see a graphical representation of how fragmented it is along with a listing of the number of fragmented files along the bottom of the window.

Click the Defragment button to begin processing-this may take some time to complete. You can interrupt the process by clicking Stop or you can tick the box to have the machine shut down when it's finished. UltraDefrag is added to the right-click menu so you can process files and folders.

If you click the Optimize button the program  rearranges your data so it's placed at the beginning of the drive. This makes it easier for Windows to access the files it needs and so should speed up your PC. From the Settings menu you can enable a boot time scan to process locked files.
